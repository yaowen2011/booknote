What [Villains] Can Teach You About Being Yourself”.  

But – mostly – I hope you’ve seen that being your best Self means standing out, means being different, means disconnecting Your Self from the lives and thoughts of others.

It means being independent.  It means being bold.  It means – at times – being alone.

And that’s fine.  That’s cool.  That’s way better than being one of them – everyone else – a sad, sorry, nobody; safe from the criticism of others, but imprisoned and stifled by the threat of that criticism.


【Death Row Inmate】
That it’s not something to be put off till X or Y future time.

That it’s not something to be put off till you have one thing or another you think you’re missing.

That it’s not something to be put off at all.

That being your best and most fucking awesome Self starts with realizing that you have few opportunities left to do it at all, and little reason not to try it at all.

Because whether you know your time of death or not, it’s coming all the same.

Cause on any given day, you have a 1 in roughly 30,000 chance of dying.  For every day you survive, those odds must surely increase.  And for every day you waste caring what others say about you, or what they think of what you do, or being weak, or being less than a leader of Your Self at least, is one less day you can be freaking awesome, and cool, and way better Bieber (pretty much the goal of all mankind).

But those who achieve in life are those willing to step forward when everyone else toes the line; those willing to speak their mind when everyone else looks around silently; those willing to lead when others will only follow.

Cause being yourself means being willing to do so despite the opinions and actions of others.  It means being yourself though others may say “Fuck you.  We like someone else.  We prefer someone else.  We choose someone else.”

Let them.

It happens to every dictator in time too.

But – more than anything – think of the strength.  The complete lack of fear, of nervousness, of belief that anyone is more capable, more dangerous, more anything than themselves.

The total and unshakeable confidence.


But…you can be a little stronger today than you were yesterday.

You can do a little more that scares you, so you have a little more that doesn’t.

You can realize that every day you’re weak is another day you’re not your best Self, not your Self at all.




How about that being yourself is more important than what others say or think.

How about that confidence gives you the ability and freedom to pursue your passions – whatever your passions may be.
How about that doing what you love because You love it is far better in life than doing what others would have you do simply because they tell you it’s better.

How about that even this villain, has something redeeming, something admirable, something inspiring.

AND SO WHAT CAN MARILYN MANSON TEACH YOU…
about being your Self.

That being different is okay.  That being different is a sign of strength.  That being different – though others may not accept you or like you – will forever be more important than being just another faceless person in the crowd.



Because these women clearly don’t give a shit what others think of them.

They don’t care.

They don’t care what others say about them, or think about them, or believe about them.  They don’t care that their family knows.  They don’t care that their friends know.  They don’t care that every person they have met or will ever meet needn’t do more than pop their name into Google to see them as any other person would only be horrified to be seen by a stranger.

Because they’re doing what they love.
