### Getting out of boxes
    With this, you will have identified clearly the three elements of your situation:
     (1)what you’re paying by remaining where you are; 
     (2) what it would cost you to get out;
     (3) what you could do once you’re out.
    No matter what the discomfort, there’s always a price you can pay to get rid of it.
    You don’t gain anything by waiting the twenty months.
    Sell it now, pay the difference, and end the problem. Then you won’t have to write those monthly
    checks anymore.
    There’s always a price you can pay to clear the record and start fresh.

    I’ve never found an exception to the rule that the sooner you pay a price, the less
    it costs you. As long as a situation continues, you pay a price just knowing that the
    situation is unresolved. And the longer a situation continues, the firmer other people
    become in their attitude that you have no right to initiate a change.

    But if I become aware of a mistake, I want to pay the price as fast as possible and clear the record.


    Every day outside a box is another day added to your free life.
    Take a look at your own life. What could you do today that would give you more
    freedom tomorrow morning?

    The Box Trap is the assumption that there’s no way out of a box. There’s  always
    a way, always a price you can pay to be rid of it once and for all. Find it and pay it.

### The Certainty Trap
    When you buy a house, you have no way of being sure the government won’t
    condemn it next year to make way for a new road.
    这里自己就是太信任政府的监管了
    You can never know for sure the thoughts or
    plans or motivations of other people.
    The important thing is to
    recognize the  limits  of the information you’re using.

    And for every risk there’s an
    accompanying  liability —  a price you’ll have to pay if things don’t go as you want them to.
    You’re in the Certainty Trap when you ignore that risk.

    Taking risks is an
    inherent part of life; it’s only dangerous when you act as though you’re  not  taking a
    risk.
    Risks are forms of prices. You gamble with time when you choose to take a risk
    instead of taking the time to be sure of what you’re doing. If you win, you’ll have saved
    time; if you lose, you’ll probably spend more time paying off the loss than you would have
    had to spend checking things out in advance.
    There’s nothing wrong with taking a risk. The danger occurs when you don’t
    recognize that you’re taking one

        You’re in the trap if you let your stockbroker’s confidence induce you to
    withdraw all your savings and bet them on one stock. 

    **How To Avoid**
    1. Popularity isn’t proof.
    2. Be skeptical about new information.
    3. Don’t expect to have an explanation for everything.
    别轻易降低警戒线
    Don’t let your guard down and plunge into situations where the risks are too great.
    4. Recognize that you’re seeing only part of what’s involved; you can’t see everything. 
    5. Recognize the risks and liabilities. And that’s the most important point. There
    are always risks, and risks mean liabilities — prices to be paid if things don’t go as
    you want them to. When you recognize them, you can handle things in ways that make
    your losses less frequent and less critical.

    **假设性原则**
    But he’s always
    known that such things were possible and outside his control, so he automatically
    assumed a risk when he crossed the street.

    **理性的人  比如  司马懿**
    Meanwhile, the reasonable person recognizes the gamble in everything he does.
    He’s quite willing to take risks, but only when he’s prepared to pay the liability if the
    risk goes against him. Mistakes, disappointments, losses don’t sidetrack him; he keeps
    moving toward the things he wants.

    **别老是 线性增长思维**
    Don’t let uncertainty prevent you from enjoying what you have. But don’t let overconfidence lead you to act upon what you don’t have yet.
    **开心宝贝说的那句话**
    This is why you have to filter information before taking it into your system of doing things.

    When you no longer count on other people to be “right,” to be certain, to be moral, to be intelligent, you’ll turn to the one source of genuine power that exists for you — yourself.

## You Can Be Free
    Your life is all you have. What could possibly be important enough to warrant throwing that life away?

     (1) Each person seeks his own mental well-being (happiness);
    and (2) Everything that happens is the effect of a prior cause.


    In any situation, ask yourself: Is this what I want for myself? If it isn’t, you don’t
    have to remain there. There are millions of people out there in the world; you have a
    lot more to choose from than just what you see in front of you now.

    You decide which information you will accept or reject. You decide what your next action will be. You decide what moral code you’ll live by.


    Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist.  — Ralph Waldo Emerson

    Relationships can be fruitful only when they’re in the self-interest of each person.

    1. Don’t think in terms of groups.
    2. Limit the relationship to what you have in common.
    3. Don’t attempt to perpetuate a relationship by contract. 

    And for B and C, the relationship is no longer just good beer and good
    conversation. Now it includes duties and obligations.

    To attempt to preserve the relationship by contract is only going to bend each of
    them out of shape. 

    If you can accept the  differences  that exist between you and those you care for,
    you can make the most of what you have together. If you try to overcome the differences,
    you’ll only make it harder to enjoy the things you  do  have together.

    Perhaps the three principles can be summed up as one important
    principle:  Let others be free.

### 学会拒绝 say no
    You have to learn to say “no” in a
    way that doesn’t create strain and conflict.

    You can’t promise to love forever — and neither can your lover.
