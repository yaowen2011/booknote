To sum up the relationship between feeling and thinking, feelings need to be
tested before being trusted, and thinking is the most reasonable and reli-
able way to test them.					--19

We have already noted one characteristic of critical thinkers?kill in
asking appropriate questions.			--21
Another is control of one? mental activi-
ties.

Effective thinkers exert control over their mental life, direct
their thoughts rather than being directed by them, and withhold their
endorsement of any idea?ven their own?ntil they have tested and
confirmed it.							--22

The basic activities in critical thinking are investigation, interpretation,
and judgment, in that order. 
The crucial thing is not to let hunches and hypotheses manipulate
our thinking and dictate our conclusion in advance.

Whenever you realize
your mind is wandering, drag it back to the task.   --26页
The only real differ-
ence is that intellectual property is purchased with mental effort rather than money. 

Agood way to begin is to keep the following thought
in mind: “I know I have limitations and can easily be mistaken. And surely
I’ll never find all the answers I’d like to. But I can observe a little more
accurately, weigh things a little more thoroughly, and make up my mind a
little more carefully. If I do so, I’ll be a little closer to the truth.”

It has been rightly said that people can seldom choose the circum-
stances life places them in, but they can always choose their responses to
those circumstances because they possess free will. 

Resisting the force of habit is always possible but never easy.

for knowing involves more than having the right answer. 
It also involves the realization that you have it.

Noted psychologist Albert Ellis, founder of the Institute of Rational-
Emotive Therapy, claims, “Man can live the most self-fulfilling, creative,
and emotionally satisfying life by intelligently organizing and disciplining
his thinking.”

Observant people,
on the other hand, have learned how to get outside themselves, to be con-
stantly in touch with what is happening around them.

It enables us to get beyond
our first impressions, feelings, preconceived notions, and personal
preferences.

Judgments are conclusions arrived at through examination of evidence
and careful reasoning. 

By systematically clarifying issues and conducting inquiry, we rescue our
thinking from preconceived notions and first impressions.

One key aspect of this evaluation process concerns the resolution
of apparent conflicts in evidence. 

Evaluating evidence consists of asking and answering appropriate ques-
tions.

Finally, taking the time to ask appropriate questions often provides a structure around
which to arrange your thoughts.

Therefore, we should make a conscious effort to keep our analyses
of ideas separate from our feelings about the people who hold
them.
